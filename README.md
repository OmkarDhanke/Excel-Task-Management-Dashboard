### Project Overview

This project is a self-contained, interactive Task Management Dashboard built in a single Microsoft Excel file. The goal is to provide a clear, at-a-glance view of project status, team workload, and key performance indicators (KPIs) to help managers make data-driven decisions.

All data, calculations, and visualizations are included within the `.xlsx` file.
